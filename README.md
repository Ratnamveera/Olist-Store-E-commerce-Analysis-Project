# Key Performance Indicators:
The objective of the Olist Store Analysis Project is to evaluate customer purchasing patterns and payment patterns on an E-commerce platform. The project focuses on a range of key performance indicators (KPIs), including weekday versus weekend sales, payment statistics, delivery time, and customer behavior. The analysis is derived from nine CSV files that are cleaned and manipulated to obtain valuable insights.

-> **Weekday Vs Weekend Payment Statistics:** By analyzing payment statistics based on weekdays and weekends, customers' buying behavior can be understood. The purpose of this KPI is to answer questions about which day of the week has the highest sales and which customers prefer to pay through online modes. Olist can improve its weekend sales and plan promotions accordingly by analyzing KPIs.

-> **Number of Orders with a review score of 5 and payment type as a credit card:** The number of orders with a review score of 5 and credit card payment type is the focus of this KPI's analysis. Understanding customer satisfaction levels and payment references can be achieved through this method. By utilizing information, Olist can identify satisfied customers and motivate them to make repeat purchases.

-> **Average number of days taken for order delivery from pet shop:** Olist's best sellers include a pet shop that delivers orders on time. The average delivery time for an order from a pet shop is analyzed by this KPI. Olist can improve its delivery time and maintain customer satisfaction by identifying areas where it can improve. 

-> **Average price and payment values from customers of Sao Paulo City:** Seo Paulo City is the largest city, and most of Olist's orders are from the same city, with 16% of sales, Rio de Janeiro with 7%, and the rest cities with 77% of sales. By analyzing the average prices and payment values of customers in Seo Paulo City, it is possible to understand their spending patterns in this region. Identifying high-value customers and creating targeted marketing campaigns are also made easier for Olist with its use.

-> **Relationship between shipping days Vs review scores:** The relationship between shipping days and review scores is the focus of this KPI analysis. Understanding the impact of delivery time on customer satisfaction levels is beneficial. Logistics optimization and delivery time improvement can be achieved by olists using this information.
# Insights: 
The data shows that Olist E-commerce has approximately 96.1K satisfied customers and 96.48K orders that have been delivered with an average delivery time of 12 days. By analyzing, business decisions can be made, focusing on products that customers are interested in, improving product and service quality, and optimizing marketing in provinces that have high total sales. About 3095 sellers at Olist deal with 32.34K products, and their sales amount to 16M with a profit percentage of 20%. The company's delivery success rate is 80%, with a rating of 4.09.
